# ai-traffic-managment-system
 Our AI Based Traffic Management System project aims to 
deploy an innovative solution leveraging artificial intelligence and advanced technologies to 
transform urban traffic control, safety, and efficiency. We seek to implement real-time traffic 
monitoring, congestion prediction, incident detection, adaptive signal control, and data-driven 
decision-making. Through these efforts, our objective is to mitigate traffic congestion, enhance 
road safety, minimize travel time, and provide insights for urban planning. Our scope 
encompasses system architecture design, data collection and processing, AI algorithm 
implementation, user interface development, integration, deployment, and continuous evaluation. 
We aim to develop a proof-of-concept prototype initially, with future phases targeting broader 
deployment and refinement based on stakeholder feedback and ongoing evaluation.
